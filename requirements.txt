# DevOps Tooling Requirements for macOS

## Homebrew (Package Manager)
Required to install most other dependencies.
- [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Core Dependencies
These tools are required for setting up the DevOps environment.
```sh
brew install --cask docker      # Docker for containerization
brew install kubectl            # Kubernetes CLI
brew install minikube           # Minikube for local Kubernetes cluster
brew install kind               # Kind as an alternative to Minikube
brew install helm               # Helm for managing Kubernetes applications
brew install argocd             # ArgoCD CLI for GitOps workflows
brew install gh                 # GitHub CLI for repository and workflow management
brew install jq                 # JSON processing tool
```

To install keda, start by connecting to a cluster
```sh
kubectl cluster-info # should say your cluster is not running
kind create cluster
kubectl get nodes # should return one node running
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kedacore/keda/releases/download/v2.16.0/keda-2.16.0.yaml
kubectl get pods -n keda

```

## Discord Webhook (Manual Setup Required)
Discord webhook URLs must be created manually:
1. In Discord Server Settings > Integrations > Webhooks.
2. Create a **Webhook**.
3. Copy the Webhook URL (`https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...`).
4. Store it in an environment variable:
   ```sh
   export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your/url
   ```

## Verification Commands
After installation, verify the tools with:
```sh
docker --version
kubectl version --client
minikube version  # or kind version
helm version
argocd version --client
gh --version
jq --version
```

## Notes
- Ensure **Homebrew is updated** before running the installations: `brew update`
- If using an **M1/M2/M3 Mac**, ensure Homebrew is installed under `/opt/homebrew/`.
